# Per-subagent statusline — decorates each row of the agent panel.
#
# This is a different mechanism from the main statusline and far less
# documented, so here is the contract, verified by reading Claude Code 2.1.226:
#
#   INPUT (stdin, a single JSON object):
#     { "columns": <usable width, frame already subtracted>,
#       "tasks": [ { "id", "name", "type", "status", "description", "label",
#                    "startTime",          // epoch, in milliseconds
#                    "model", "effort",
#                    "contextWindowSize",  // may be missing
#                    "tokenCount",
#                    "tokenSamples": [ ... ]   // history, up to 16 samples
#                    "cwd" } ] }
#
#   OUTPUT: JSONL — one {"id": "...", "content": "..."} line per agent.
#     Lines that fail to parse are dropped with an error in the log, so always
#     exit 0 and print nothing when something goes wrong.
#
#   CADENCE: first tick after 300ms, then every 5s, with a 5s timeout.
#
# The interesting field is `tokenSamples`: Claude keeps each agent's usage
# history, so we can draw a sparkline and tell at a glance which one is really
# working and which has been stuck for a while. A bare number cannot tell
# "20k tokens and climbing" from "20k tokens, frozen a minute ago".
#
# Everything happens in a single jq: the input is an array and the work is
# arithmetic over lists, which jq expresses more briefly and runs faster than
# looping in bash with one process per row.
