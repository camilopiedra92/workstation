# ---------- PATH ----------
# There is none here on purpose. PATH is built in .zshenv and re-asserted in
# .zprofile after macOS runs path_helper; setting any of it here would mean a
# directory that exists only where a terminal is attached, which is the bug
# those two files exist to close.

# ---------- History ----------
# The most useful thing and the one almost nobody configures: by default zsh
# keeps few lines and loses them when several windows close at once.
#
# Under state and not config: this is data the shell writes, not something you
# edit or would ever want versioned. XDG draws that line and zsh, being older
# than the spec, does not -- hence the explicit path.

setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS      # a repeated command does not clutter history
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE         # command with a leading space = not saved
setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
setopt HIST_VERIFY               # when expanding !!, show before running
setopt SHARE_HISTORY             # history shared across terminals
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY          # store a timestamp for each command

# ---------- Behavior ----------
setopt AUTO_CD                   # "Development" == "cd Development"
setopt AUTO_PUSHD                # every cd pushes the previous one
setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
setopt INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS      # allow # comments at the prompt
setopt NO_BEEP

# ---------- Plugins (antidote) ----------
# Safety net: several ohmyzsh plugins write here and outside the framework the
# variable does not exist.

# ---------- Completion ----------

# fzf-tab replaces the native menu, so it is disabled to avoid duplication

# ---------- Runtimes ----------
# mise manages node, python, go... per the mise.toml of each project
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"

# ---------- Prompt ----------
eval "$(starship init zsh)"

# ---------- Smart navigation ----------
# zoxide learns from your cd's: "cd dotfiles" jumps there from anywhere.
#
# --cmd cd is zoxide's own way of taking over cd, and replaces `alias cd='z'`.
# The alias left `cd` completing as the builtin, so tab offered subdirectories
# of the current directory and never the database zoxide had just learned.
eval "$(zoxide init --cmd cd zsh)"

# ---------- Fuzzy finding ----------
# Ctrl+R  history   |   Ctrl+T  files   |   Alt+C  cd into a directory

# ---------- Keys ----------
# Up/down arrows search history by what you have already typed.
#
# Both sequences, which is what the plugin's own README asks for: a terminal in
# normal mode sends ^[[A and in application mode ^[OA, and which one you get
# depends on whether something enabled the keypad transmit mode. Binding one of
# the two leaves the arrows silently falling back to plain history in the other.

# ---------- Aliases ----------

# Update the whole environment at once (antidote included)
alias update-all='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && mise upgrade && antidote update'

# Windows interop, deliberately narrow. These are the only Windows binaries
# this environment calls, and naming them individually is what keeps
# /mnt/c/... off PATH -- see the note in .zshenv about why that matters for
# correctness and not only for speed.
alias explorer='explorer.exe'
alias clip='clip.exe'

# ---------- Editor ----------
export EDITOR="code --wait"
export VISUAL="$EDITOR"

# ---------- Claude Code ----------
alias c='claude'
alias cc='claude --continue'    # resume the last session in this folder

# ---------- Greeting ----------
# Around 10ms, so the cost is not the reason for the guard: a banner reprinted
# by every nested shell turns a greeting into noise. SHLVL is 1 in a terminal
# tab and in an editor's integrated terminal, and only grows when a shell is
# opened inside another one.

# ---------- Local (not versioned) ----------
# For secrets, tokens and settings specific to this machine. Next to this file
# rather than in $HOME, so everything zsh reads lives in one directory.
